
## Compatibility Note

This tutorial is designed to be compatible with various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, and others. While the examples and commands provided are based on an Ubuntu server, they can be easily adapted to your specific Linux distribution.

### Package Manager Variations

- For Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, the package manager used is `apt`. If you're using a different distribution, such as CentOS or Fedora, you can replace the `apt` commands with the appropriate package manager for your distribution (e.g., `yum` or `dnf`).
- Example: Replace `apt install package-name` with `yum install package-name` or `dnf install package-name`.

### Firewall Command Variations

- In this tutorial, the firewall commands are demonstrated using `ufw`, the default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu. If you're using a different distribution, you can substitute the `ufw` commands with the appropriate firewall management commands for your distribution (e.g., `iptables` or `firewalld`).
- Example: Replace `ufw allow port` with the appropriate command for your firewall management tool.

Please ensure to consult the documentation or resources specific to your Linux distribution for accurate commands and package management guidelines.
