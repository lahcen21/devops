SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a program used to facilitate the sending, receiving, and relaying of outgoing emails between mail servers, enabling communication between senders and receivers. This section provides a guide on installing and configuring an SMTP server with Postfix on Ubuntu. SMTP is essential for email communication, as it determines which servers will receive relay messages.

A mail server encompasses systems responsible for collecting, processing, and delivering email messages. Every email message must pass through a mail server before reaching its intended recipient, much like a traditional mail carrier.

Without servers, email communication would be limited to recipients within the same domain. SMTP servers provide addresses that mail clients or applications can establish connections with, facilitating the transmission of emails.

Postfix serves as the mail transfer agent (MTA) for sending and receiving emails. It can be configured to restrict usage to local applications, which proves useful in scenarios where third-party email service providers impose limitations on sending email notifications or when handling significant outgoing traffic. Despite its lightweight nature, Postfix retains essential functionality, making it a suitable option for maintaining an efficient SMTP server setup.

## Prerequisites

Configure DNS settings on your Ubuntu server to ensure proper domain resolution. DNS plays a crucial role in email delivery by translating domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. Proper DNS configuration ensures that your SMTP server can resolve domain names and deliver emails to the correct destinations.
